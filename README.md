Project Description:

BETTERLOG is a social networking platform designed for Battlefield enthusiasts seeking an alternative to Electronic Arts' Battlelog. The project is currently in development, but we can already present its core principles.

Project Objective:
BETTERLOG aims to create a central community hub for Battlefield enthusiasts, where players can enjoy a versatile gaming experience and participate in various events such as leagues and tournaments with external rating system. 
Our platform will be designed to facilitate easy event organization and participation, allowing users to share their experiences and compare their statistics with others.

Discord Authentication:
Login will be possible only through Discord. We want to avoid gathering private data as much as possible.

Full integration with Battlefield 3 and VU is planned, however it may pose significant challenges during implementation.

What you can expect from BETTERLOG:

    Player Profiles: Create personalized profiles where you can share your achievements and statistics.
    Community Forums: Engage in discussions, share experiences, and connect with other gamers.
    Event Calendar: Stay updated on upcoming tournaments, leagues, and other events.
    Chat: Chat with friends and challenge them for a fight!
    Ranked System: Will you gain rating around 90? We will see ;) 

We aim to create a central meeting place for all those who love Battlefield 3.
